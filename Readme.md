# Rip Van BluRay

## Overview

Rip Van BluRay is a service that runs on a Computer with One or Many Optical Disk Drives. When running, when a Disc is inserted into one of the drives it will identify the type of Disc (Music CD, DVD, BluRay) and begin to rip it. Afterwards it will eject the Disc and will be ready to rip again.

## Dependencies

1. **Linux** - I wrote this using Ubuntu as the main distrobution but in theory any Linux Distribution could work.

    Currently I recommend running the system with a GUI interface as configuring MakeMKV, at this point in time, is easier.

2. **MakeMKV** - The brains behind ripping Movies/TV on Disc (DVD, BluRay, 4K UHD)

    MakeMKV is free in its current Beta state but requires a beta key available on the MakeMKV forums. I do recommend buying a Registration Key for prolonged use.

    - ccextractor - Required for Ripping Closed Captions (MakeMKV will complain if not installed)

3. **ABCDE** - Probably the best Music ripping software around

    - flac - This automation rips Music CDs to flac for Quality and Portability
